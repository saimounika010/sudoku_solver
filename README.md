A Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm fills empty cells sequentially, trying each number from 1 to 9 while ensuring no violations of Sudoku rules. If a number placement leads to a conflict, the solver backtracks by removing the number and tries the next possible option. This recursive process continues until the entire grid is correctly filled or all possibilities are exhausted, indicating no solution exists.
